# A collection of projects for The Children's Agenda Rochester

This is a collaboration on a few projects for volunteer time by a group of friends.

### Guidelines:
 - If you're starting a new component, please create a subfolder, a project, and branch.
 - Please track issues / features as functional requirements -- break up the features as you see fit.
 - Each project may be completed using different languages or tools.
 - As you write code please emphasize readability and extensability as if you were mentoring someone who was going to take over.

### Projects:
