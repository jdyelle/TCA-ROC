# A collection of projects for The Children's Agenda Rochester

This is a collaboration on a few projects for volunteer time by a group of friends.

### Just Getting Started:
 - We're really only working on the Census Analytics project for now. It is composed of a UI component, a backend, and a simple console app to test with.
 - [Here's a link to the getting started guide for Census Analytics](https://github.com/jdyelle/TCA-ROC/tree/master/CensusAnalytics)
 - Beginner-friendly issues should be tagged with "good first issue"

### Guidelines:
 - If you're starting a new component, please create a subfolder, a project, and branch.
 - Please track issues / features as functional requirements -- break up the features as you see fit.
 - Each project may be completed using different languages or tools.
 - As you write code please emphasize readability and extensability as if you were mentoring someone who was going to take over.

### Projects:
